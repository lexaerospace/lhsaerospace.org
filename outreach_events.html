<p style="padding: 14px; border: 2px solid #ecbb40; color:#ecbb40">The Aerospace Club would be glad to help teach children about model rocketry in schools and other locations near Lexington. If you would like to schedule an event for a school, please fill out the form below and we will give a reply as soon as possible. Since our main goal is to support the hobby of building model rockets, all of our visits to will be free of charge. Hope to see you soon!


<br><br> The form will be coming soon...<br></p>
