<p style="padding:10px;border:2px solid #ecbb40; color:#ecbb40;"> For the last year, our captains have been working jobs to fund most of
the club expenses, as well as connecting donations from team members and neighbors.

<br>
<br>

Creating this team in the middle of the pandemic has made it extremely
difficult to get substantive funding from local businesses and community
donations. Our current way of funding the team depends on captains
and team donations, which is largely unsustainable.

<br>
<br>

 We would greatly appreciate any amount of monetary funding to
keep our team afloat, especially after the potential we have shown
after just two years of development.
