<p style ="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid #ecbb40; color:#ecbb40">The Aerospace Club wants to help promote the hobby to people of all ages. Therefore, we have been coming up with many ideas towards completing this goal. Some examples are posting tutorials on YouTube, helping children learn during the summer, or even expanding out to building free-flight/RC airplanes. This club hopes that every person can have the oppurtunity to experience the wonders in air and space flight. 
<br>
<br> Outreach ideas will be brought up during club meetings and/or in our Discord server. If you have your own ideas, please share them with us. :)
