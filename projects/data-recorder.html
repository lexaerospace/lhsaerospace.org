<p style ="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid #ecbb40; color:#ecbb40">The data recorder is one of the more interesting projects that the Aerospace Club is currently working on. The main goal is to automate as much of the data recording and analysis for rocket flights as possible.

<br><br>This means that we will have to create a ground station device to capture launch info like temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind-speed, etc. All of this will be accompanied with software, which will help analyze and interpret all of the data we receive.

<br><br>The end product will be a small device box that can be plugged into a computer at the launch site, automatically recording all of the data and streaming it into an application. The user will then be able to double-check it, and enter in other important info like rocket mass, apogee, and flight time. The data received at different flights will be compiled and establish a pattern which can give us a more accurate prediction for future launches.

<br><br>We plan to use Arduino as the primary physical device and Python for the data analysis.
