<p style ="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid #ecbb40; color:#ecbb40">The Aerospace Club has created an open-source part CAD library on Github.

<br><br>The files in this library use STEP/STL formatting. However, many of our parts still need to be flight proven. <br><br>

You are welcome to help contribute to the OSHRockets repo. Go to the link below and scroll through the README for a clear descripition on the standards for contribution. Once you have your CAD files and documentation, simply make a pull request and your parts will be added to the library!</p>
