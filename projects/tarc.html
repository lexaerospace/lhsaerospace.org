<p style ="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid yellow" >Every year, the Aerospace Club sends two teams to participate in The American Rocketry Challenge. There are twenty people that participate, ten in each team. 

<br><br> 

Whenever a new school year begins, the Aerospace Club will be looking for new members to take the vacant spots in the TARC group. Even though there aren't enough spots for everybody, there will still be plenty of other club projects available. Read the other pages in "Projects" to view our current projects. 

<br><br>
More TARC information will be explained at our club meetings.
